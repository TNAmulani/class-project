       <h4>How We Came To Being</h4>
       <div id="about">
     <section>     
       <p class="letter">I bought the property as a cattle ranch for the purpose of breeding cattle which is and was my original business. I became aware of the mineral resources when prospectors and illegal miners squatted on the property attracted by the gold deposits. It was then necessary for me to peg and register my own claims thereby securing the mineral rights in order to protect the property from encroaching trespassers. My interest in mining developed as from 1997. Mining gold was undertaken on a modest financial scale and production was more in the form of surface exploratory work rather than full scale mining. The limited success and immense potential gradually captivated my interest and attention to invest more into equipment and development to mine the rich surface reefs until I eventually reached the stage of operating a thriving small scale mining operation.</p>
       <p class="letter">I have now accumulated equipment all financed by the mining operation itself. I was at first engaged in mining as a sole proprietor and then as a registered company Murland Mining [Pvt] Ltd. Our mining activity has always remained in essence as small scale being constrained by our limited finance to adequately exploit the promising great potential underground mineral resource. Our recoveries over the years have averaged on a monthly basis between 1kg to 2kg per month, which at our level of operation adequately sustains and compensates us. We are also engaged in cyanide vat leaching a 50,000ton sand dump which we have accumulated over the years from our milling and mining activity.</p>
       <p class="letter">We are open to any investor who is willing to partner us in a joint venture to explore, develop and realise the potential from the large resources indicated by <a href="Reports/GeoPhysical Report.pdf" class="image" alt="">geophysical surveys and geological soil sampling surveys</a> which have been undertaken.</p>
